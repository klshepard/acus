# Acus
Implantable CMOS Deep-Brain Fluorescence Imager with Single-Cell Resolution

1- "BSS" folder contains all the code necessary to run the blind source separation algorithm. Along with the code, a sample real-life in vivo dataset is also provided. This dataset and its output can be plotted by running "sinan_barePixel_separability_AT.m" file.
2- Simulation run for BSS can be completed by creating randomly generated beads and their expected images on Acus, including the shot noise. This can be achieved by uncommenting the steps 2 and 3 before running the step 4v2.

3- "Temporal_Data_Analysis" folder contains all the code necessary to demonstrate a time series data in multiple channels. A sample dataset is provided with the code. Use the "data_analysis_plot.m" file to plot the temporal data.
