Implantable CMOS Deep-Brain Fluorescence Imager with Single-Cell Resolution

1- "BSS" folder contains all the code necessary to run the blind source separation algorithm. Along with the code, a sample real-life in vivo dataset is also provided. This dataset and its output can be plotted by running "sinan_barePixel_separability_AT.m" file. After changing the 
2- Simulation run for BSS can be completed by uncommenting the steps 2 and 3 before running the step 4v2 without the for loop. The loop is there for the video reconstruction, whereas the simulation creates only a static random scene.

3- "Temporal_Data_Analysis" folder contains all the code necessary to demonstrate a time series data in multiple channels. A sample dataset is provided with the code.
